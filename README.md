# KTTR (Korea Train Ticket Reservation) Application


## Running KTTR locally
KTTR is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):

```
git clone https://github.com/f-lab-edu/kttr.git
```
